# Internet security

Samsung takes a number of steps to protect its Internet-compatible Smart TVs against unauthorized incursions and hacking. For example, certain sensitive communications between the TV and the Internet servers are encrypted. In addition, the TV’s operating system has adopted controls to prevent the installation of unauthorized applications. Although we take steps to protect your Smart TV and personal information, no Internet-connected device or transmission is completely secure. We therefore encourage you to take additional steps to safeguard your TV, secure your Internet connection, and minimize the risk of unauthorized access. These steps are listed below:
- • When Samsung releases software updates to improve the security of your TV, you should promptly install these updates. To automatically receive these updates, turn on Auto Update in the TV's menu ( > Settings > Support > Software Update > Auto Update). When an update is available, a popup message appears on the TV screen. Accept the software download and update by selecting YES when prompted. Take steps to secure your wireless router and network. Your router's manual should provide additional details about how to implement the following measures:
- – Secure your wireless router's management settings with a unique password to prevent unauthorized changes to security related settings.
- – Implement standard encryption (e.g., WPA2 encryption) on your wireless router to secure your wireless network signal.
- – Secure access to your wireless network with a hard-to-guess password.
- – Confirm your router's firewall setting is enabled (if so equipped).
- – Make sure that all your Internet-connected devices are behind your network's firewall.
- – If your router or modem has a standby mode button, use it to disconnect your home network from the Internet when it is not in use.
- • Use strong passwords for all your Internet accounts (Netflix, Facebook, etc.). If your TV has a camera, recess the
- camera into the TV's bezel when it is not in use. Recessing the camera makes it inoperative.
- • If any unexpected messages appear on your TV screen requesting permission to link a device or enable a remote session, do NOT accept.
- • Do not visit suspicious web sites and do not install any suspicious programs. We recommend that users install only those authorized apps provided by Samsung through Samsung Smart Hub.

# Mounting the TV on a wall

![Image](images\image_03b6efa0-0f77-4649-9049-564404fac69a.jpg)

If you mount this TV on a wall, follow the instructions exactly as set out by the manufacturer. Unless it is correctly mounted, the TV may slide or fall and cause serious injury to a child or adult and serious damage to the TV.

For models providing wall mount adapters, install them as shown in the figure below before installing the wall mount kit.
- • Refer to the installation manual included with the Samsung wall mount kit.

![Image](images\image_4958957d-b0f0-4ce5-88d9-97afda4b5b3b.jpg)
- • Samsung Electronics is not responsible for any damage to the product or injury to yourself or others if you choose to install the wall mount on your own.
- • To order the wall mount kit, contact Samsung Customer Care at 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864).
- • You can install your wall mount on a solid wall perpendicular to the floor. Before attaching the wall mount to surfaces other than plaster board, contact your nearest dealer for additional information. If you install the TV on a ceiling or slanted wall, it may fall and result in severe personal injury.
- • When installing a wall mount kit, we recommend you fasten all four VESA screws.
- • If you want to install a wall mount kit that attaches to the wall using two top screws only, be sure to use a Samsung wall mount kit that supports this type of installation. (You may not be able to purchase this type of wall mount kit, depending on the geographical region.)
- • Standard dimensions for wall mount kits are shown in the table below.
- • If you are installing a third-party wall mount, note that the length of the screws you can use to attach the TV to the wall mount is shown in column C in the table below.

![Table](images\table_eab7cd4c-4686-47b7-ba6d-ce04d7ef26d4.jpg)

English - 8

![Image](images\image_09160c54-3319-4ac3-b43a-81859ebce4cd.jpg)

Do not install your wall mount kit while your TV is turned on. This may result in personal injury from electric shock.
- • Do not use screws that are longer than the standard dimension or do not comply with the VESA standard screw specifications. Screws that are too long may cause damage to the inside of the TV set.
- • For wall mounts that do not comply with the VESA standard screw specifications, the length of the screws may differ depending on the wall mount specifications.
- • Do not fasten the screws too firmly. This may damage the product or cause the product to fall, leading to personal injury. Samsung is not liable for these kinds of accidents.
- • Samsung is not liable for product damage or personal injury when a non-VESA or non-specified wall mount is used or when the consumer fails to follow the product installation instructions.
- • Do not mount the TV at more than a 15 degree tilt.
- • Always have two people mount the TV onto a wall.

# Providing proper ventilation for your TV

When you install your TV and One Connect, maintain a distance of at least 4 inches between the TV and One Connect with other objects (walls, cabinet sides, etc.) to ensure proper ventilation. Failing to maintain proper ventilation may result in a fire or a problem with the product caused by an increase in its internal temperature. When you install your TV with a stand or a wall mount, we strongly recommend you use parts provided by Samsung Electronics only. Using parts provided by another manufacturer may cause difficulties with the product or result in injury caused by the product falling.

# Safety Precaution: Securing the TV to the wall to prevent falling

![Image](images\image_66ad2735-7343-4d51-833e-fc63a4574db3.jpg)

Caution: Pulling, pushing, or climbing on the TV may cause the TV to fall. In particular, ensure your children do not hang on or destabilize the TV.

WARNING: Never place a television set in an unstable location. The television set may fall, causing serious personal injury or death. Many injuries, particularly to children, can be avoided by taking simple precautions

# such as
- • Using cabinets or stands recommended by the manufacturer of the television set.
- • Only using furniture that can safely support the television set.
- • Ensuring the television set is not overhanging the edge of the supporting furniture.
- • Not placing the television set on tall furniture (for example, cupboards or bookcases) without anchoring both the furniture and the television set to a suitable support.
- • Not placing the television set on cloth or other materials that may be located between the television set and supporting furniture.
- • Educating children about the dangers of climbing on furniture to reach the television set or its controls.

If you are retaining and relocating the television set that you are replacing with this new set, you should apply the same precautions to the old set.

![Image](images\image_94b861b9-f720-46cd-8b9c-c1c9a92b3017.jpg)

Eco Sensor adjusts the brightness of the TV automatically. This feature measures the light in your room and optimizes the brightness of the TV automatically to reduce power consumption. If you want to turn this off, go to > Settings > General > Eco Solution > Ambient Light Detection.
- • If the screen is too dark while you are watching TV in a dark environment, it may be due to the Ambient Light Detection function.
- • The eco sensor is located at the bottom of the TV. Do not block the sensor with any object. This can decrease picture brightness.

Caring for the TV • If a sticker was attached to the TV screen, some debris can remain
- after you remove the sticker. Please clean the debris off before watching TV.

- • The exterior and screen of the TV can get scratched during cleaning. Be sure to wipe the exterior and screen carefully using a soft cloth to prevent scratches.
- • Do not spray water or any liquid directly onto the TV. Any liquid that goes into the product may cause a failure, fire, or electric shock.
- • To clean the screen, turn off the TV, then gently wipe away smudges and fingerprints on the panel with a micro-fiber cloth. Clean the body or panel of the TV with a micro-fiber cloth dampened with a small amount of water. After that, remove the moisture with a dry cloth. While cleaning, do not apply strong force to the surface of the panel because it can damage the panel. Never use flammable liquids (benzene, thinner, etc.) or a cleaning agent. For stubborn smudges, spray a small amount of screen cleaner on a micro-fiber cloth, and then use the cloth to wipe away the smudges.
